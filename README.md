# ExcelVersionControl

> **Git-inspired version control for Microsoft Excel workbooks used in Investment Banking, Private Equity, Corporate Finance, and FP&A.**

ExcelVersionControl is a backend application built with **Spring Boot** that modernizes the way financial teams manage Excel workbooks. Inspired by Git, the platform centralizes workbook management, parses Excel files, maintains audit trails, and lays the foundation for workbook versioning, comparison, and collaborative financial modeling.

Rather than managing multiple copies of the same financial model through emails and shared folders, ExcelVersionControl provides a centralized and secure solution for workbook management.

# Problem Statement

Financial analysts frequently exchange Excel workbooks while creating valuation models, financial statements, forecasting models, and budgeting reports.

This often results in multiple copies of the same workbook:

```text
AsianPaints.xlsx
AsianPaints_v2.xlsx
AsianPaints_FINAL.xlsx
AsianPaints_FINAL_FINAL.xlsx
AsianPaints_CLIENT.xlsx
```

As multiple analysts work on the same workbook, several challenges arise:

- Duplicate workbook copies
- Difficulty identifying the latest version
- No centralized storage
- No audit history
- High operational risk
- No workbook comparison
- No rollback capability

ExcelVersionControl aims to solve these challenges by introducing Git-inspired concepts into Excel workbook management.

     ├── Docker Compose Deployment
     └── Deploy Updated Application
```

This pipeline ensures that every commit is automatically validated, tested, packaged, containerized, and deployed.

---

# Docker Deployment

The application is fully containerized using Docker.

Docker Compose provisions:

- Spring Boot Application
- PostgreSQL Database

Both services communicate through Docker's internal network, ensuring a reproducible and isolated deployment environment.
